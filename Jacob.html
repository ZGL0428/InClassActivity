<h1> The Cowboys will Go 12-5 This Year and Lose in the NFC Championship </h1>

<a href="index.html"> In Case You Don't Want to Understand Why the Cowboys are a Top 5 Team in the NFL</a> 



<h3> Introduction </h3>
<p> I believe that the Cowboys will go 12-5 in 2021, which would easily be enough to win the weak NFC East. First, an important caveat. I don't think that the Cowboys would go 12-5 if they played in any other division. However, being in the NFC East means that the Cowboys will play 6 games against teams that all had a losing record in 2020. Outside of their division rivals, the Philadelphia Eagles, the Cowboys have the easiest schedule out of the 32 NFL teams, meaning that their opponents' winning percentage in 2020 was the second-lowest in the NFL. Furthermore, on the Cowboys' schedule, there are very few games that the Cowboys are heavy underdogs. The Buccaneers game in Week 1 was an example of that type of game, where the Cowboys managed to hold the game extremely close. But we'll get to that later. 
</p>
  
<h3> Cowboys' Offense </h3>  
<p> So, you may ask, how is a team that went 6-10 the year before in the same weak division going to improve their record by 6 wins? Well, first of all, the best player on the Cowboys, Dak Prescott, missed every game after Week 7 with an ankle injury last year. In addition, the Cowboys' three best offensive linemen, Tyron Smith, Zack Martin, and La'el Collins, the first two of which are All-Pro and, in all probability, future Hall of Famers, missed a combined 34 games. This strong offensive line and good quarterback are supplemented by Ezekiel Elliott, an above average running back who becomes great when he's placed behind the Cowboys' O-line and when defenses have to focus on stopping Dak. Furthermore, Amari Cooper is always a great first option, and with his skill relying more on precise route running than speed, he will not deteriorate as much as other receivers as he gets older. Many experts project that CeeDee Lamb is going to have a breakout season in his second year, partly because of his own skill, but also because of the great passing game the Cowboys have already established. With Cooper, Lamb, and Michael Gallup, the Cowboys' pass game should be extremely strong this year. 
With all these players back, the Cowboys' offense should be back to their previous strength, like in 2019, when they led the league in yards per game and were sixth in points per game. We know the Cowboys' offense will be good. The question is whether it will be good enough to outweigh their defense's weaknesses. 
</p>
  
<h3> Cowboys' Defense </h3>
<p> However, the Cowboys' issue has always been their defense. While their offense has consistently been towards the very top of league for the last five years, their defense has been among the worst, forcing them into mediocrity. However, the Cowboys have made a couple of key defensive additions that should help them significantly in 2021. First of all, they signed Keanu Neal in the offseason, and transitioned him from strong safety to linebacker. To be a safety, one must be fast, and hopefully Neal can add to the Cowboys' defensive coverage by playing an important role in zone coverage and in guarding slot receivers and tight ends. Furthermore, with the 12th pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, the Cowboys picked Micah Parsons, a linebacker from Penn State will surprising speed and explosiveness. If Randy Gregory manages to stay healthy and out of trouble again, he, DeMarcus Lawrence, and Parsons could be a scary pass rush. Finally, the Cowboys hired a new defensive coordinator, Dan Quinn. No one actually knows if Quinn will be better than Rod Marinelli or Mike Nolan, but he will at least try to rejuvenate the Cowboys' struggling defense. I'm not saying that the Cowboys' defense will be good, or even average, but even just slightly below average with a weak schedule and superpowered offense could give the Cowboys a 12-5 or even 13-4 season.

<p> Seen Above: Trevon Diggs is the greatest defensive player on the Cowboys since Deion Sanders, and is easily the best cornerback in the league. </p>

<h3> First Two Games </h3>
<p> In the first two weeks, the Cowboys showed promise. Their two best offensive lineman, Zack Martin and Tyron Smith, both were out for one game, and that showed in the Cowboys' lack of a run game in Week 1. Nonetheless, Dak proved he was an elite quarterback capable of competing with the reigning super bowl champs in an away game. The Cowboys' defense was not too bad, and though they let up 30 points, they were playing against the greatest quarterback of all time. If missed field goals were taken into account, the Cowboys would have won fairly easily. If the Cowboys were to lose a game, this is the best possible way to lose, and I would even consider it a moral victory. In the second week, the Cowboys' defense played extremely well against Justin Herbert and a good Chargers' offense. While the Cowboys' offense was not as good as in Week 1, the defense played well, and the Cowboys won a game that I would have considered one of their more difficult matchups at the beginning of the year. 
</p>

<h3> Conclusion </h3>
<p> So, are the Cowboys going to win the Super Bowl? Yes. Eventually. With an improved defense, the Cowboys' superpowered offense will thrive, steamrolling teams in a similar way to the Chiefs or the Ravens. However, at least for this season, the Cowboys will have to content themselves with being significantly above average, but not being quite good enough to overcome their defensive liabilities. If they did make the playoffs, they probably are not quite good enough yet to have a good shot against the Bucs, Chiefs, or any other team of that caliber.
